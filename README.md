# Smart-Traffic-Light-System-using-Sensors-and-AI
The Smart Traffic Light System uses sensors at intersections to collect real-time traffic data. An AI algorithm analyzes this data to optimize signal timing, prioritizing busy roads. A communication network enables real-time interaction between sensors, AI, and traffic lights, improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, and enhancing safety.
